# Traffic Sign Classifier ðŸš¦

This project implements a Traffic Sign Classifier using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. The model is trained to accurately identify and classify different types of traffic signs, a crucial component in autonomous vehicle systems and traffic management solutions.

# ðŸ“‚ Project Overview
Traffic signs play an essential role in guiding and controlling traffic. Accurate recognition is vital for the safe operation of self-driving vehicles. This project uses the GTSRB dataset to train a deep learning model for traffic sign classification.

# ðŸ’» Features
Dataset: Utilized the GTSRB dataset, which includes over 50,000 images spanning 43 categories of traffic signs.
Model: Implemented a deep learning model using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch (details inside the notebook).
Evaluation: Achieved high accuracy in classification, with detailed metrics and visualization of results.
Augmentation: Enhanced training through image preprocessing and data augmentation techniques
